Automating Model Deployment with Docker

This project focuses on automating the deployment of the YOLOv5 COCO model using Docker. The key highlights include:

Objective: Streamline the deployment process by containerizing the YOLOv5 model for consistent and scalable application across environments.
Approach:
The model was first deployed and tested using MLflow to ensure functionality.
Subsequently, the focus shifted to Docker, where an Ubuntu-based Docker image was created to host and deploy the model.
Required dependencies, including Python and YOLOv5, were installed and configured within the Docker container.
Results: The deployment was successfully automated using Docker, providing an isolated, portable environment for the YOLOv5 COCO model.
By the end of the project, the entire deployment process was containerized, enabling easy replication and scalability. The final solution was successfully uploaded and executed in a Docker environment.
